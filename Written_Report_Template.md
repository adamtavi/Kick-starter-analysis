# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
 Project

	Overview of the project is to help Louise analyze crowdfunding data to assess project outcome. The analysis helps Louise understand what the story is based on the 	data. I uncover data trends and patterns by calculating summary statistics, identifying outliers, and performing excel analysis with visualizations. 

### Purpose

	Purpose of this project is to analyze and assess how different campaigns compared in relation to their respective launch dates and funding goals. The analysis shows 	the monthly outcome for each campaign specifically in the Theater Parent Category. It also dives into the outcomes for the Play Subcategory and percentages segregated 	into specific funding intervals. The conclusions should help Louise assess how well funding goals were met.

## Analysis and Challenges

	Based on the below central tendencies, it seems that the successful projects met their goal by having a more realistic or lower amount to reach. The mean goal of 		$5,049 compared to the failed $10,554 shows that being too aggressive or optimistic about raising the goal resulted in funding not meeting expectations. Most optimal 		goal standard is between $3,500 and $5,000 based off IQR 1 and IQR 3. In addition, those project that failed showed to have a mean pledged of $559 totally out of the 		mean goal of $10,554 which one could provide more evidence that goal expectation is aligned to the actual.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

	The outcomes based on launch date proved to show that theater outcomes seem to be drived by having higher voume and in turn higher successfull outcomes in the summer 		vs the winter. The data shows that fall heading into winter launch dates did not fair well and further analysis on why that's the case should be in review when 		discussing potential launch dates. Specifically for theater there is a trend that launch date plays a huge role in the May - July months.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
	
	Outcomes based on goal was broken down by serval goal funded intervals to see if there is any correlation. The data shows that the higher goal ammount the less likely 		that the goal was met. Keeping goal numbers low and stingent should be a priority as 73% of projects successfully completed projects betweeen $1000 -$4999.


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
	
	I didn't face any challenges along the way. one challenge I faced was when you are working with big data sets and having multiple tabs can slow down the computer 	speed. Might be more benefical having multiple different excel workbooks instead of bunching them all in one workbook.

## Results

What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

	Conclusion #1
	One conclusion based on theater outcomes by launch date is that projects that had a launch date in the summer months (May, June, July) outperformed all other seasonal 		timeframes by having a higher count of successful projects and having more projects launched. More projects seem to be launched in those months and provided a better 		outcome. 

	Conclusion #2
	Another conclusion based on theater outcomes by launch date is that the winter months, January, and December, had very poor outcomes. Failed outcomes reached half or 		almost equal to the number of successful outcomes in the months of December and January. However, based on the data, 61% of project were successful in meeting their 		goal as a whole.


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

	Conclusion from outcomes based on goals is that the more realistic, or lower the goal was the more successful the project was in meeting their goal. You can see based 		on the data as the goal increased so did the chance of it not meeting its goal.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

	Limitations based on this scenario is I am coming from a perspective where I am not involved in this industry / knowledgeable prior to working with the data. If I were 	to be in the industry every day, I would be able to understand the why behind the trends rather than providing assumptions why the trends are correlating a certain 		way.


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
	
	One possible bar graph could show the difference in percent successful and failed for all product types to show how they faired against each other. A great way to see 		what types of Parent categories prove to be more successful than others.Some other possible graphs that you could create is a Pivot table that had all the Parent and 		Sub Categories and they're outcomes. It could show a very detailed few of how projects faired.
